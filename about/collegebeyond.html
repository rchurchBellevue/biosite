        <p>Entering college, Jeni was aiming to complete a combination degree in English and Art education.  Bellarmine University was about 2.5 hours
            from Henderson, so although she lived on campus, it was still close enough to drive home on weekends.  A few weeks into school she met her 
            future husband Ryan.

                <h3>Education Track</h3>
                <p>The education track involved a heavy course load as well as several student teaching or observation assignments.</p>

                    <li> Samuel Coleridge Grade School--observing grade school education</li>
                    <li> St Paul's Preschool--observing pre-K education</li>

                <h3>Other Highlights from college</h3>
                <p>Although the course load was heavy, Jeni had a close circle of friends that led a quite life compared to some other students.
                    Evenings were spent playing Mario Kart, watching television, and the periodic trips to restaurants for food.
                    She also had a stint as a cartoonist for the University newspaper <i>The Concorde</i>, as well as an editor position over
                    the literary journal <i>The Ariel</i>

        <h3> A change of plans</h3>
        <p>During her student teaching assignment senior year, Jeni became aware that the idea she had in her head of teaching and the reality had 
            become starkly different since high school.  With classroom overcrowding, an increased workload, and a focus on meeting testing guidelines,
            it was a far cry from her high school teachers who could devote time to all students and create a positive working relationship.
        </p>
        <p>Although she interviewed for a few positions, she ultimately chose not to pursue an education career.  So what to do?
            In her  words she began to look for </p>
               <blockquote>I wanted to find a career where I felt useful, 
                that was something I would look forward to going to each day, 
                and which enabled me to put my skill set to use.  </blockquote>

        <h2>Working with Local Animal Groups</h2>
        
        <div class="row">
        <div class="column1">
        <p>As part of a senior year seminar, Jeni was required to do some volunteer work with a local organization.  With her love of cats,
            she chose the opporunity to work with a local rescue group, the Animal Protection Association in Jeffersonville, Indiana.  Though,
            originally this was intended to just be for a few weeks, she has been associated with the group for almost twenty years at this point.
            She has even served as secretary and president for a few years.

            This is a group that is near and dear to her heart and would recommend anyone check out their 
            <a href="https://www.apa-pets.org/">website</a> to see the great work
            the all volunteer group is doing.

            She also works to educate people about the adoptability of cats with FIV+(Feline Immunodeficiency Virus).  People tend to assume
            this is a terminal disease in cats, when actually cats can live long and healthy lives with this condition.  Our household has 
            has several cats with this condtion that are leading perfectly happy lives.  As part of her promotion of FIV+ cats, she 
            even got a tattoo to strike up conversations.
