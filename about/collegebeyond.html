        </div>

        <hr>
        <p>Entering college, Jeni was aiming to complete a combination degree in English and Art education. Bellarmine
            University was about 2.5 hours
            from Henderson, so although she lived on campus, it was still close enough to drive home on weekends. A few
            weeks into school she met her
            future husband Ryan.

                <h3>Education Track</h3>
                <p>The education track involved a heavy course load as well as several student teaching or observation
                    assignments.</p>

                    <li> Samuel Coleridge Grade School--observing grade school education</li>
                    <li> St Paul's Preschool--observing pre-K education</li>

            </div>
            <div class="column">
                <h3>Other Highlights from college</h3>
                <p>Although the course load was heavy, Jeni had a close circle of friends that led a quite life compared
                    to some other students.
                    Evenings were spent playing Mario Kart, watching television, and the periodic trips to restaurants
                    for food.
                    She also had a stint as a cartoonist for the University newspaper <i>The Concorde</i>, as well as an
                    editor position over
                    the literary journal <i>The Ariel</i>
                </p>

        </div>

        <h3> A change of plans</h3>
        <p>During her student teaching assignment senior year, Jeni became aware that the idea she had in her head of
            teaching and the reality had
            become starkly different since high school. With classroom overcrowding, an increased workload, and a focus
            on meeting testing guidelines,
            it was a far cry from her high school teachers who could devote time to all students and create a positive
            working relationship.
        </p>
        <p>Although she interviewed for a few positions, she ultimately chose not to pursue an education career. So what
            to do?
            In her words she began to look for </p>
        <blockquote><i>I wanted to find a career where I felt useful,
            that was something I would look forward to going to each day,
            and which enabled me to put my skill set to use. </i></blockquote>
        <p>She has held several positions since college, but in each one she's looked for a sense of purpose and the 
            opportunity to help others.  One of the highlights was her time at the Kentucky Humane Society
        </p>

                <h4>Kentucky Humane Society</h4>
                <p>Although she never followed her childhood dream of becoming a veterinarian, With her love of animals, working at
                    the Kentucky Humane Society for years was a perfect match. She spent
                    several years as an adoption counselor, which allowed her to connect adopting families with the perfect cat or dog for their
                    household.  As seen in the picture, sometimes those perfect matches for cats happened to be with her family.
                </p>
                <p> In addition to her time in the adoptions department, she also served for several years in the community relations and 
                    fundraising department.  Though not as hands on with animals, this did allow her the opportunity to connect with 
                    donors and volunteers to help keep money coming in to support the good work the KHS was doing.

        <h4>Working with Local Animal Groups</h4>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column">
                <p>Although her jobs have changed, something that has always been part of her adult life is voluntering.
                    As far back as 2003, Jeni was required to do some volunteer work with a local
                    organization. With her love of cats, she chose the opporunity to work with a local rescue group, the Animal Protection Association in
                    Jeffersonville, Indiana.</p>
                <p> Though, originally this was intended to just be for a few weeks, she has been associated with the group for
                    almost twenty years at this point.  She has fostered/adopted several animals from the shelter, as well as assisting with
                    planning fundraising activities to allow the group to support it's adoptable cats.  She even served as president of the group
                    during the difficult time of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
                </p>
                <p> This is a group that is near and dear to her heart and would recommend anyone check out their
                    <a href="https://www.apa-pets.org/">website</a> to see the great work
                    the all volunteer group is doing.
                </p>    

                <p> She also works to educate people about the adoptability of cats with FIV+(Feline Immunodeficiency
                    Virus). People tend to assume this is a terminal disease in cats, when actually cats can live long and healthy lives with this
                    condition. Her household has has several cats with this condition that are leading perfectly happy lives. As part of her promotion
                    of FIV+ cats, she even got a tattoo to help show her support and prompt conversations about this issue.
