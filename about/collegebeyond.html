                <h3>A change of plans</h3>
                <p>During her student teaching assignment senior year, Jeni became aware that the idea she had in her head of
                    teaching and the reality had
                    become starkly different since high school. With classroom overcrowding, an increased workload, and a focus
                    on meeting testing guidelines,
                    it was a far cry from her high school teachers who could devote time to all students and create a positive
                    working relationship.
                </p>
            </div>
            <div class="collegeitem5">
                <h3>Entering the workforce</h3>
                <p>Although she interviewed for a few positions, she ultimately chose not to pursue an education career. So what
                    to do?  She set out with a goal for the positions she was looking for and entered the workforce
                </p>              
                <p>She has held several positions since college, but in each one she's looked for a sense of purpose and the 
                    opportunity to help others.  This has led to positions in retail, healthcare, and nonprofit work.
                    One of the highlights was her time at the Kentucky Humane Society
                </p>

            <div class="collegeitem6">
                <h3>Her career goals</h3>
                <blockquote><i>I wanted to find a career where I felt useful,
                    where I would look forward to going to each day,
                    and which enabled me to put my skill set to use. </i></blockquote>

                <h4>Kentucky Humane Society</h4>
                <p>Although she never followed her childhood dream of becoming a veterinarian, With her love of animals, working at
                    the Kentucky Humane Society for years was a perfect match. She spent
                    several years as an adoption counselor, which allowed her to connect adopting families with the perfect cat or dog for their
                    household.  As seen in the picture, sometimes those perfect matches for cats happened to be with her family.
                </p>
                <p> In addition to her time in the adoptions department, she also served for several years in the community relations and 
                    fundraising department.  Though not as hands on with animals, this did allow her the opportunity to connect with 
                    donors and volunteers to help keep money coming in to support the good work the KHS was doing.  One of the highlights
                    of this was an "Art for the Animals" event she organized with artists decorating banks to help collect donations
                    for the organization.

                <h4>Volunteering with Animal Rescue</h4>

                <p>Although her jobs have changed, something that has always been part of her adult life is volunteering.
                    With her love of cats, she has been with a local rescue group since 2003, the Animal Protection Association in
                    Jeffersonville, Indiana.  <a href="https://www.apa-pets.org/">website</a></p>
                <p>  She has fostered/adopted several animals from the shelter, as well as assisting with
                    planning fundraising activities to allow the group to support it's adoptable cats.  She even served as president of the group
                    during the difficult time of the Covid-19 Pandemic.
                </p>
                <p>
                    She also works to educate people on the adoptability of cats with FIV(Feline Immunodeficiency Virus).  This disease
                    has a negative stigma around it, even though cats can live long healthy lives with the condition.  She has even
                    designed a tattoo for herself that shows her support for these special cats.
