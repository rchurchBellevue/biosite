                <h3>Birth </h3>
                <p>Jeni's parents Kent and Janet were living in Michigan when they were offered the change to take over running a 
                    Best Western hotel in Perrysburg, Ohio.  They were enroute to Ohio when her mother went into labor, and Jeni was 
                    born in Lansing, Michigan.</p>
                <p>
                    For the first 10 years or so of her life she lived in an apartment within the hotel her parents ran, along with her 
                    stepbrother Brandon and younger brother Brian.

                <h3>The start of a beautiful friendship</h3>
                <p>One night when her aunt was visiting, she mentioned that there was a cat outside under the bushes in the hotel.</p>
                <p> Jeni was able to go out and befriend the orange bobtailed cat and "Stubby" was soon part of the family.  Jeni's
                    time with Stubby and other cats helped start her lifelong love of animals and her desire to help as many as possible.</p>
                <p>This originally led to her wanting to be a veterinarian when she grew up.  In high school biology she had to dissect
                    a frog, and although she made it through that without issue, it did make her realize that as a verterinarian she wouldn't
                    be able to save every creature she saw, which made her reconsider her career plan.

                <h3>A talent for art</h3>
                <p>Jeni has always shown an aptitude for art, from winning a coloring contest in 1st grade, to excelling in art classes in middle
                    and high school.</p>
                <p>With nurturing and support from her English and art teachers in high school, Jeni would go on to apply for
                    the Kentucky Governor's Scholar program For the Arts.  Although she didn't get in, it did make her decided that perhaps a career in education
                    might be a good career path.
