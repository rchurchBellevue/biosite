                <h3>Birth </h3>
                <p>Jeni's parents Kent and Janet were living in Michigan when they were offered the chance to take over
                    running a Best Western hotel in Perrysburg, Ohio. They were enroute to Ohio when her mother went into labor,
                    and Jeni was born in Lansing, Michigan.</p>
                <p>
                    For the first 10 years or so of her life she lived in an apartment within the hotel her parents ran,
                    along with her stepbrother Brandon and younger brother Brian.

                <h3>The start of a beautiful friendship</h3>
                <p>One night when Jeni's aunt was visiting, she mentioned that there was a cat outside under the bushes in
                    the hotel.</p>
                <p> Jeni was able to go out and befriend the orange bobtailed cat and "Stubby" was soon part of the
                    family. Jeni's time with Stubby and other cats helped start her lifelong love of animals and her desire to help as
                    many as possible.</p>
                <p>Jeni originally thought about becoming a veterinarian when she was younger, but realized at a later point that it was not
                    the career for her.  Despite this, she would provide a loving home for several cats in her childhood, as well as
                    being involved with animal rescue organizations later in life.

                <h3>A talent for art</h3>
                <p>Jeni has always shown an aptitude for art.  She remembers winning a coloring contest in 1st grade, and
                    also showed great skill in her middle and high school classes.</p>
                <p>With nurturing and support from her teachers in high school, Jeni would apply for
                    the Kentucky Governor's Scholar program For the Arts.   This is a competitive state summer school program for those with
                    great aptitude in the arts.   Although she didn't get in, she did travel to Bellarmine University for the interview,
                    which ultimately led to her choosing that school for her college education.  Noting how valuable the support from her
                    teachers were in this process, she entered college with the aim to get her degree in high school education.
