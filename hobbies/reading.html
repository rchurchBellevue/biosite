                <h3>An Appreciation of Literature</h3>
                <p>With the benefit of great teachers in high school, Jeni developed a love of reading, be it fiction or
                    non-fiction.
                    To say she is an avid reader is an understatement. In 2023 alone she's nearing 90 books read or
                    listened to.
                    You can follow along with her progress on her <a

                </p>
                <p> For Jeni, a fiction story is a way to be transported to another world, another time, and another
                    perspective.
                    Non-fiction allows her to learn something new or to experience something from a different perpective

                <h4>Favorite Work of Fiction</h4>
                <p> <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>by Harper Lee is a classic work that's read by many a high-school
                    student. For Jeni,
                    it's her favorite work of fiction. In her words, it's a very relatable story of growing up and
                    learning
                    some truths about the world. But perhaps the key takeaway, is the idea of doing what's right, even
                    if it's not the
                    popular opinion

                    Finch</blockquote>
                <p>This idea has stuck with Jeni and remains one of the many reasons she loves the book</p>

                <h4>Favorite Non-Fiction Work</h4>
                <p> When working at Half-Price Books if someone wanted something unique to read, Jeni would recommend
                    <i>Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers</i> by Mary Roach.
                    The book goes into a study of how bodies donated to science are utilized in a variety of fields,
                    while also providing
                    scientific insight to what happens to the physical body after one dies..
                </p>
                <p>Jeni feels the author does a great job of detailing the facts of the biology of the decomposition
                    process while
                    also maintaining a respectful attitude.
