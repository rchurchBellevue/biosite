            <h3>Puzzles</h3>
        
            <p>When the Covid-19 epidemic hit in 2020, a lot of people were stuck at home needing something to fill their time.
                    Although Jeni had always enjoyed doing jigsaw puzzles as a child, she really embraced the activity during the
                    pandemic and beyond. 
            </p>
            <p>For her, puzzles are a good way to keep her mind active and to provide a sense of accomplishment when 
                    one has been completed.  Perhaps the only downfall is our cats seem to want to help with the puzzles which
                    can make the process difficult.
            </p>
