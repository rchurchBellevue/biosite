                <p>With her artistic ability, Jeni has found an outlet in using her creative skills around the house.
                    Whether
                    it's doing the work herself
                    or consulting with a contractor to implement her designs, she has come up with many unique ways to
                    improve
                    the house.
                </p>
                <h4>The Kitchen Penny Backsplash</h4>
                <p>One of the first large scale projects taken on was something to spruce up the kitchen walls after a
                    remodel.
                    There are many trending designs for using things like glass tile, stone, or other materials, but
                    Jeni wanted
                    to find a different approach.</p>
                <p> Realizing the cost of materials, she happened upon the idea of using copper pennies
                    which when washed would provide a nice metallic contrast to the rest of the kitchen. A trip to the
                    bank and quite a few
                    rolls of pennies later the project was started. Utilizing grout, the pennies were secured to the
                    kitchen walls and then
                    polished to make sure they looked their brightest. The result is a lower cost and a quirky design
                    for the kitchen.

        <h4>Cat Calendar Mod Podge Bench</h4>
        <p>After a recent remodel we had a new "mud bench" in our front hallway to store shoes and other items. Although
            the
            original pine color was nice, Jeni wanted to jazz it up a bit. Using some old images from a
            <a href="https://www.fatcatart.com/?lang=en"> FatCatArt</a> calendar, an idea popped into her head as to how
            to put
            a personal touch on the bench.</p>
            <p> After staining the bench, she arranged the images in the desired locations,
            and then
            applied a product known as Mod-Podge to the images. This product acts as a combination glue, waterproofer,
            and sealer,
            so the images would be secure and have a layer of protection from any spills. After applying over ten coats,
            the bench
            was finally done and is quite impressive.
