        <h3>An Appreciation of Literature</h3>
        <p>With the benefit of great teachers in high school, Jeni developed a love of reading, be it fiction or non-fiction.</p>
        <p> For Jeni, a fiction story is a way to be transported to another world, another time, and another perspective.  
            Non-fiction allows her to learn something new or to experience something from a different perpective

                <h4>Favorite Fiction Work</h4>
                    <p> <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>by Harper Lee is a classic work that's read by many a high-schooler.   For Jeni,
                    it's her favorite work of fiction.  In her words, it's a very relatable story of growing up and learning
                    some truths about the world.  For her though, the idea of Atticus Finch doing the right thing 
                    even though it's not popular is a lasting theme that's been a  great inspiration.   </p>

                <h4>Favorite Non-Fiction Work</h4>
                    <p> <i>Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers</i> by Mary Roach is a unique book.  With a scientific yet still 
                    respectful attitude, the book goes into the use of human bodies used in medical or scientific research.</p>
                    <p>It's nothing like you've read before and Jeni often recommends this book to someone looking
                        for something unique to read.

        <h3>DIY Projects Around the House</h3>
        <p>With her artistic ability, Jeni has found an outlet in using her creative skills around the house.  Whether it's doing the work herself
            or consulting with a contractor to implement her designs, she has come up with many unique ways to improve the house.

                <h3>Penny Backsplash</h3>
                <p>One of the first large scale projects taken on was something to spruce up the kitchen walls after a remodel.
                    There are many trending designs for using things like glass tile, stone, or other materials, but Jeni wanted
                    to find a different approach.  Realizing the cost of materials, she happened upon the idea of using copper pennies
                    which when washed would provide a nice metallic contrast to the rest of the kitchen.  A trip to the bank and quite a few
                    rolls of pennies later the project was started.  Utilizing grout, the pennies were secured to the kitchen walls and then 
                    polished to make sure they looked their brightest.  The result is a lower cost and a quirky design for the kitchen.

        <h3>Cat Calendar Mod Podge Bench</h3>
            <p>After a recent remodel we had a new "mud bench" in our front hallway to store shoes and other items.  Although the
                original pine color was nice, Jeni wanted to jazz it up a bit.  Using some old images from a 
                <a href="https://www.fatcatart.com/?lang=en"> FatCatArt</a> calendar, an idea popped into her head as to how to put
                a personal touch on the bench.  After staining the bench, she arranged the images in the desired locations, and then
                applied a product known as Mod-Podge to the images.  This product acts as a combination glue, waterproofer, and sealer,
                so the images would be secure and have a layer of protection from any spills.  After applying over ten coats, the bench
                was finally done and is quite impressive.
