        <h3>An Appreciation of Literature</h3>
        <p>With the benefit of great teachers in high school, Jeni developed a love of reading, be it fiction or
            non-fiction.
            To say she is an avid reader is an understatement. In 2023 alone she's nearing 90 books read or listened to.
            You can follow along with her progress on her <a
                href="https://www.pinterest.com/catlady912/2023-reads/">2023 reads list</a> on Pinterest.
        </p>
        <p> For Jeni, a fiction story is a way to be transported to another world, another time, and another
            perspective.
            Non-fiction allows her to learn something new or to experience something from a different perpective

                <h4>Favorite Work of Fiction</h4>
                <p> <i>To Kill a Mockingbird</i>by Harper Lee is a classic work that's read by many a high-school
                    student. For Jeni,
                    it's her favorite work of fiction. In her words, it's a very relatable story of growing up and
                    learning
                    some truths about the world. But perhaps the key takeaway, is the idea of doing what's right, even
                    if it's not the
                    popular opinion

                    Finch</blockquote>
                <p>This idea has stuck with Jeni and remains one of the many reasons she loves the book</p>

                <h4>Favorite Non-Fiction Work</h4>
                <p> When working at Half-Price Books if someone wanted something unique to read, Jeni would recommend
                    <i>Stiff: The Curious Life of Human Cadavers</i> by Mary Roach.
                    The book goes into a study of how bodies donated to science are utilized in a variety of fields,
                    while also providing
                    scientific insight to what happens to the physical body after one dies..
                </p>
                <p>Jeni feels the author does a great job of detailing the facts of the biology of the decomposition
                    process while
                    also maintaining a respectful attitude.

        <h3>DIY Projects Around the House</h3>

        <div class="row">
            <div class="column12">
                
                <p>With her artistic ability, Jeni has found an outlet in using her creative skills around the house.
                    Whether
                    it's doing the work herself
                    or consulting with a contractor to implement her designs, she has come up with many unique ways to
                    improve
                    the house.
                </p>
                <h4>The Kitchen Penny Backsplash</h4>
                <p>One of the first large scale projects taken on was something to spruce up the kitchen walls after a
                    remodel.
                    There are many trending designs for using things like glass tile, stone, or other materials, but
                    Jeni wanted
                    to find a different approach.</p>
                <p> Realizing the cost of materials, she happened upon the idea of using copper pennies
                    which when washed would provide a nice metallic contrast to the rest of the kitchen. A trip to the
                    bank and quite a few
                    rolls of pennies later the project was started. Utilizing grout, the pennies were secured to the
                    kitchen walls and then
                    polished to make sure they looked their brightest. The result is a lower cost and a quirky design
                    for the kitchen.

        <h4>Cat Calendar Mod Podge Bench</h4>
        <p>After a recent remodel we had a new "mud bench" in our front hallway to store shoes and other items. Although
            the
            original pine color was nice, Jeni wanted to jazz it up a bit. Using some old images from a
            <a href="https://www.fatcatart.com/?lang=en"> FatCatArt</a> calendar, an idea popped into her head as to how
            to put
            a personal touch on the bench.</p>p>
            <p> After staining the bench, she arranged the images in the desired locations,
            and then
            applied a product known as Mod-Podge to the images. This product acts as a combination glue, waterproofer,
            and sealer,
            so the images would be secure and have a layer of protection from any spills. After applying over ten coats,
            the bench
            was finally done and is quite impressive.

        <h3>Puzzles</h3>
        <div class="row">
   
                <p>When the Covid-19 epidemic hit in 2020, a lot of people were stuck at home needing something to fill their time.
                    Although Jeni had always enjoyed doing jigsaw puzzles as a child, she really embraced the activity during the
                    pandemic and beyond. 
                </p>
                <p>For her, puzzles are a good way to keep her mind active and to provide a sense of accomplishment when 
                    one has been completed.  Perhaps the only downfall is our cats seem to want to help with the puzzles which
                    can make the process difficult.
